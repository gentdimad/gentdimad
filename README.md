# Arvic Gingoyon 

### _AI / Machine Learning Engineer_

<span>I'm currently working on</span> **AI finetuning, developing Agentic workflows, creating efficient RAG systems, and building empathetic AI, at Liamoon**.

<span>At the same time, I'm also building a community to </span> **help AI adoption in the Philippines**!

**Fun fact:** When I'm not at my desk, building, or studying, I'm most probably at a pool place in Cebu, playing 9-ball or a new game format I've been getting into- banks.
